Description: 
        i2py provides tools for converting programs and scripts written in Research
        System Inc.'s IDL programming language to Python.  It is not an IDL-compatible
        front end for the Python interpreter, nor does it make any attempt to replicate
        the functionality of the IDL standard library.  Rather, its only purpose is to
        perform source-to-source conversion of legacy IDL code to Python.  Currently,
        it supports only procedural IDL, although support for object-oriented code may
        be added in the future.
